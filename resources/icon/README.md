# Icon Resources

This directory should contain the application icons in various formats and sizes.

For BeeWare/Briefcase applications, you typically need:

- icon.png (512x512 pixels) - Main application icon
- icon.ico (Windows)
- icon.icns (macOS)
- Various Android/iOS specific icon sizes

You can generate these from a single high-resolution PNG using tools like:
- `briefcase create` (will generate placeholder icons)
- Online icon generators
- ImageMagick for batch conversion
